This repository contains defininition and implementation(s) for the "Travel card problem" code kata. This is my very first, own code kata. Feel free to contribute!
----------------
Inhabitants of crowded capitals require a fluently working, standardized system for using the public transportation. In many cities travel cards are provided and used for handling this problem alongside the regular tickets. This Code Kata aims to solve the problems of a simple travel card system in an imaginary city. 

This Kata was inspired by the Helsinki transportation system. See the references section to learn more about the system in use and extend your practices with more complex system.
